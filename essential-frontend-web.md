- Variables and Constants
> Note: <br> In just about every programming language and programs, we have to keep track of many pieces of data, such as marks in an exam, 
a date of birth, email addresses, position of an image on the screen, current score in a game etc.
So we create variables to hold that data. A variable is a container, its you grabbing a little piece of computer
memory and giving it a name, so that we can use it while our program is running.
We create it, we name it, we put a value in it and we change the value as we need to.

> In Java you create a variable like this:<br/>
> Syntax: `<data type> <identifier name>;`<br/>
> Examples:<br/>
> `int myInteger;`<br/>
> `String myString;`<br>

> Thus, variables store information that you plan to change and reuse over time. On the other hand, Constants store information that is, well, constant.
