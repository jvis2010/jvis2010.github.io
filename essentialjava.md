# Essesntial Java topics
## Necessary Java that's needed for good foundation in coding

 `System.out.println("Hello Java");`

## Java Environment and Tools
- Installing the JDK
- Configuring IDE
- Creating a project
- Running the project and inspecting output

## Hello Java
- The main() method
- Variables
- Statements (note: statements describe all activities of a program; statements appear inside methods and classes)
- Expressions (Expressions produce values; an expression is evaluated to produce a result that is to be used
as part of another expression or in a statement)

## Java Language, Hello Again
- Comments
- Javadoc comments
- Variables and Constants
In just about every programming language and programs,
In all programs and all programming languages, we have to keep track of many pieces of data email addresses,
a date of birth, position of an image on the screen, current score in a game etc.
So we create variables to hold that data. A variable is a container, its you grabbing a little piece of computer
memory and giving it a name, so that we can use it while our program is running.
We create it, we name it, we put a value in it and we change the value as we need to.
> In Java you create a variable like this:<br/>
> Syntax: `<data type> <identifier name>;`<br/>
> Examples:
> `int myInteger;`
> `String myString;`

Thus, variables store information that you plan to change and reuse over time.
On the other, Constants store information that is, well, constant.
- Statements
- Expressions
- Types
- Operators
- Arrays

## Statements and Expressions, Again
- Control flow statements
  - if/else conditionals
  - switch statements
- Looping statements
  - do/while statement
  - while statement
  - the for statement
  - the enhanced for loop
- break/continue
- Unreachable statements
- Assignment
- The null value
- String type
- Variable access
- Method invocation

## Objects in Java
- Object creation (Note: we look at object creation in detail in a later section) 
- The instanceof operator
- Arrays
- Types and Classes and Arrays, Oh My!!

## Classes and Objects
- Declaring and Instantiating Classes
- Accessing Fields and Methods
- Access modifiers preview
- Methods
  - Local variables
  - Shadowing
  - Argument passing
- Method overloading

## Object creation
- Constructors
- Working with overloaded constructors
- Object destruction
- Wrappers for primitive types

## Packages
- Importing classes
- Custom Packages
- Member Visibility and Access
- Compiling with Packages

## Advanced Class Design
- Subclassing and Inheritance
- Interfaces

## Text (Note: Parsing and formatting text is a large, open-ended topic.)
- Constructing Strings
- Strings from Objects
- Comparing Strings
- Searching
- String Method Summary
- Parsing Numbers
- Tokenizing Text

## Utilities
- The java.lang.Math Class
- Local Dates and Times
- Comparing and Manipulating Dates and Times
- Time Zones
- Parsing and Formatting Dates and Times
- Parsing Errors
