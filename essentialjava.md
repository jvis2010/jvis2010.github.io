# Essesntial Java programming

This course will cover the basic knowledge needed for writing Java programs.
Participants will write, compile and execute Java programs, with special emphasis on basics, programming techniques and
key practices of object-oriented programming.

 ```java
 System.out.println("Hello Java");
 ```

### 0. Java Environment and Tools
- Installing the JDK
- Configuring IDE
- Creating a project
- Running the project and inspecting output

### 1. Hello Java
- The main() method
- Variables
- Statements 
> Note:<br> statements describe all activities of a program; statements appear inside methods and classes.
- Expressions
> Note:<br> Expressions produce values; an expression is evaluated to produce a result that is to be used as part of another expression or in a statement.

<hr>

### 2. Java Language, Hello Again
- Comments
- Javadoc comments
- Variables and Constants
> Note: <br> In just about every programming language and programs, we have to keep track of many pieces of data, such as marks in an exam, 
a date of birth, email addresses, position of an image on the screen, current score in a game etc.
So we create variables to hold that data. A variable is a container, its you grabbing a little piece of computer
memory and giving it a name, so that we can use it while our program is running.
We create it, we name it, we put a value in it and we change the value as we need to.

> In Java you create a variable like this:<br/>
> Syntax: `<data type> <identifier name>;`<br/>
> Examples:<br/>
```java
int myInteger;
String myString;
char aSingleLetter;
```

> Thus, variables store information that you plan to change and reuse over time. On the other hand, Constants store information that is, well, constant.

- Statements
- Expressions
- Types
- Operators
- Arrays

### 3. Statements and Expressions, Again
- Control flow statements
  - if/else conditionals
  - switch statements
- Looping statements
  - do/while statement
  - while statement
  - the for statement
  - the enhanced for loop
- break/continue
- Unreachable statements
- Assignment
- The null value
- String type
- Variable access
- Method invocation

<hr>

### 4. Objects in Java
- Object creation
> Note: we look at object creation in detail in a later section 
- The instanceof operator
- Arrays
- Types and Classes and Arrays, Oh My!!

### 5. Classes and Objects
- Declaring and Instantiating Classes
- Accessing Fields and Methods

- Methods
  - Local variables
  - Shadowing
  - Argument passing

<hr>

### 6. Object creation
- Constructors
- Working with overloaded constructors
- Object destruction
- Wrappers for primitive types

### 7. Packages
- Importing classes
- Custom Packages
- Member Visibility and Access
- Compiling with Packages

<hr>

### 8. Advanced Class Design
