## Only the *Necessary* stuff for an effective learning, no fluff!!

 <body>
 Hello HTML!
 </body>
 </html>
 ```

## Initial HTML
- Installing the JDK
- Configuring IDE
- Creating a project
- Running the project and inspecting output

## Hello Java
- The main() method
- Variables
- Statements 
> Note:<br> statements describe all activities of a program; statements appear inside methods and classes.
- Expressions
> Note:<br> Expressions produce values; an expression is evaluated to produce a result that is to be used as part of another expression or in a statement.

## Java Language, Hello Again
- Comments
- Javadoc comments
- Variables and Constants
> Note: <br> In just about every programming language and programs, we have to keep track of many pieces of data, such as marks in an exam, 
a date of birth, email addresses, position of an image on the screen, current score in a game etc.
So we create variables to hold that data. A variable is a container, its you grabbing a little piece of computer
memory and giving it a name, so that we can use it while our program is running.
We create it, we name it, we put a value in it and we change the value as we need to.

> In Java you create a variable like this:<br/>
> Syntax: `<data type> <identifier name>;`<br/>
> Examples:<br/>
> `int myInteger;`<br/>
> `String myString;`<br>

> Thus, variables store information that you plan to change and reuse over time. On the other hand, Constants store information that is, well, constant.
