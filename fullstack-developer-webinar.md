  > Note: <br> Polyglot programming is the future of software application development, and the future is already here! <br>
  > Polyglot programming refers to building applications using one or more special-purpose languages in addition to
  > to a general-purpose language. <br>
  > When we build web applications today, we primarily a general-purpose language (Java, Python etc.), SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (in the form of various libraries). <br>
  > An experienced programmer already is polyglot, without even thinking about it. <br>
  > For example, SQL is so closely entwined into software application development that we take it for granted.<br>
  > The polyglot style of development will continue in the future in different styles!
